1. Question:
Who are the most common types of threat actors in cybersecurity?
List at least four types, and for each one, provide:
   * Their primary motive
   * One real-world example of an attack attributed to them
.1. Nation-State Actors: They are Government-sponsored groups or military cyber units




   * Motives: Espionage, which involves the gathering of sensitive data to gain geographical or industrial advantages.
        Political control: which uses this means to manipulate public opinion, influence elections, stabilize, and destabilize the government.
Cyber warfare: which  extends these actions by utilizing digital, offensive, and disruptive attacks—such as malware or ransomware—to damage critical infrastructure and paralyze an opponent's capabilities


   * Example: The allegedly targeted Iran’s nuclear program


2. Unskilled Attackers (Script Kiddies): They are individuals with limited technical knowledge.


   * Motives: Fame, boredom, fun, or experimentation
   * Example:  A group of self-proclaimed script kiddies used a DDoS tool called "Lizard Stresser" to shut down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live during the Christmas holidays, disrupting services for millions of gamers purely for the "thrill" of it. 
3. Hacktivists: Ideologically or politically motivated individuals or groups
   * Motives: Promote a cause or expose perceived injustice
   * Example: Anonymous hacking campaigns against government sites


4. Insider Threats: Employees, contractors, or business partners
      * Motives? Revenge, money, carelessness
      * Example: An employee stealing customer data before leaving a job


5. Organized Crime Groups: Cybercriminal gangs running like a business
 
      * Motives: To make a profit.
      * Example: A group encrypting an entire hospital’s data and demanding Bitcoin to restore it
2. Question:
Define the following types of malware and give one real-world example for each:
      * Virus: A virus is a type of self-replicating malware that attaches itself to other programs and executables without the user's permission.
      * Worm: A worm is a type of self-replicating malware that copies itself from computer to computer without user intervention.
      * Trojan horse: It does more than monitor the system. it is a type of contained, Non-replicating malware that disguises itself as legitimate software in order to allow scammers and hackers access to a user's system.
      * Ransomware: Ransomware is a case of the malicious actors blocking access to data or threatening to publish data unless the client pays them
      * Spyware: Spyware is a malware downloaded without a user's authorization, which is used to steal sensitive information.
      * Rootkit: It is a collection of malicious programs that secretly provide continued, privileged access to a system for unauthorized. A rootkit can create a backdoor on acomputer to let the hacker in.
3.Practical Task – Analyze a Suspicious File
 
You received a suspicious file named suspicious.txt, which contains a long Base64-encoded string. Your job is to analyze and decode it step by step using CyberChef or Linux terminal tools, and determine what the script is doing.
 
 
Sample Base64-Encoded Script:
IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKZWNobyAiSGFja2VkISBZb3VyIHN5c3RlbSBpcyBjb21wcm9taXNlZCIKcm0gLXJmIC8qCg==



 
 
Instructions – Using CyberChef:
      1. Open CyberChef.
      2. Paste the Base64 string into the input field.
      3. In the Recipe panel, apply “From Base64”.
      4. Observe the decoded output.
      5. Analyze each line of the script.

Questions to Answer:
         * What do you observe after decoding the script?
         * What does each line of the Bash script do?
         * Is the script harmful? Why or why not?
         * Why would an attacker encode this script in Base64?


 
  
  

            * What do you observe after decoding the script? Decoding the Base64 string reveals a short Bash script (a command-line script for Linux/Unix-based systems). The encoded "gibberish" in the Input field was converted into plain, readable code in the Output field.
            * What does each line of the Bash script do? The script contains three distinct lines:
#!/bin/bash: This is called a shebang. It tells the operating system to use the Bash interpreter to execute the commands in the file.
echo "Hacked! Your system is compromised.": This is a simple print command. It displays that specific text string on the user's terminal or screen.
rm -rf /*: This is the "payload" command.
            * rm: Remove files/directories.
            * r:- Recursive (deletes everything inside folders).
            * -f: Force (ignores warnings and never prompts for confirmation).
            * /*: Targets every single file and folder starting from the root directory of the system.
            * Is the script harmful? Why or why not? Yes, this script is extremely harmful. The final line, rm -rf /*, is often referred to as a "system killer." If run with administrative (root) privileges, it will attempt to delete every file on the computer, including the operating system itself, user data, and connected drives. It essentially bricks the software environment and results in total data loss
            * Why would an attacker encode this script in Base64? An attacker uses Base64 encoding for several sneaky reasons:
            * Bypassing Security Filters: Many email filters, firewalls, or Antivirus (AV) programs look for "hot" keywords like rm -rf. By encoding it, the script looks like a harmless random string of text, allowing it to slip past basic detection.
            * Obfuscation: It hides the script's true intent from a human user. A person might be more likely to run a mysterious string of text out of curiosity than a command that clearly says "delete everything."
            * Ease of Transport: Base64 turns binary or special-character data into standard ASCII text, which ensures the code doesn't get corrupted or broken when being pasted into terminals, scripts, or web forms.


4. Social Engineering Attack Vectors
         Question:
What is social engineering, and why is it considered a serious cybersecurity threat?
Social engineering is a manipulative technique that exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to data, systems, or physical spaces. Instead of using a "brute force" attack to crack a password, a social engineer might simply call an employee pretending to be from IT and ask for it.


Why It Is a Serious Cybersecurity Threat.
Social engineering is often considered the "weakest link" in security for several critical reasons:
            * Exploits Human Trust: Most security systems are designed to keep outsiders out, but social engineering targets the people already on the inside who have "keys to the kingdom".
            * Low Technical Barrier: Attackers do not need to be master coders or hackers; they only need to be persuasive enough to trick someone.
            * Bypasses Technical Safeguards: Firewalls and encryption are useless if a legitimate user is tricked into running a harmful script (like the Base64-encoded one seen earlier) or handing over their credentials via a phishing link.
            * High Success Rate: Techniques like phishing use urgency and fear (e.g., "Account Suspension Notice") to override a person’s logical thinking, making them act before they can verify the source.
            * Scalability: As seen in your phishing example, an attacker can send a generic but professional-looking email to thousands of people at once, knowing that statistically, at least a few will fall for it.


Analysis Questions:
            * What is this type of attack? This is a phishing attack, specifically an email-based attempt to deceive a user into providing sensitive login credentials.




            * What tactics does this email use to trick the victim? The email employs several psychological and technical triggers to manipulate the recipient:
The email employs several psychological and technical triggers to manipulate the recipient:
            * Urgency: The subject line starts with "URGENT," and the body sets a strict 24-hour deadline to create panic.
            * Fear: It threatens an account suspension, which motivates the user to act quickly to avoid losing access.
            * Generic Greeting: It uses the non-specific "Dear User" rather than a personalized name, allowing the attacker to send the same email to thousands of potential victims simultaneously.
            * Deceptive URL: The link http://secure-verification-portal.login-update.com uses keywords like "secure," "verification," and "login-update" to appear official, even though it is not a legitimate corporate domain.




            * Why might this email be difficult to detect as fake? This email might bypass a user's initial suspicion because:
            * Professional Language: The tone is formal and mimics standard IT communication style.
            * Minimalist Design: It avoids flashy graphics or obvious spelling errors that often trigger "spam" mentalities in modern users.
            * Plausible Scenario: Security alerts regarding "suspicious activity" are common in real digital life, making the pretext feel authentic.


            * Who is most likely to fall for this phishing attempt? While anyone can be tricked by a well-timed email, the most vulnerable groups include:
            * Non-Technical Employees: Users who may not know how to inspect a URL or identify a non-secure (HTTP) link.
            * Busy Professionals: People multitasking or feel overwhelmed might skim the email and click the link without scrutiny.
            * Those with High Security Concerns: Individuals who are particularly worried about their digital security may react impulsively to an "account compromised" alert.
5.Vulnerability Discovery with Nmap and Nikto

Analysis Questions:
            * What ports are open?
            * What vulnerabilities did Nikto detect?




.        
Analysis Questions
– What ports are open? 80/tcp: Open (HTTP) — Running Apache httpd 2.4.58.
                              135/tcp: Open (MSRPC) — Running Microsoft Windows RPC.
               139/tcp: Open (NetBIOS-SSN) — Running Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn.
             443/tcp: Open (SSL/HTTP) — Running Apache httpd 2.4.58.
             445/tcp: Open (Microsoft-DS) — Likely for Windows File Sharing.
              2179/tcp: Open (VMRDP) — A Microsoft Hyper-V related service.
                    3306/tcp: Open (MySQL) — Running a MySQL database.


What vulnerabilities did Nikto detect? 1. Missing Security "Shields" (Headers)
            * Clickjacking Risk: The server is missing a header (X-Frame-Options) that prevents other websites from putting your page in a hidden frame to steal your clicks.
            * MIME Sniffing Risk: It's missing a setting (X-Content-Type-Options) that tells browsers not to "guess" what kind of file it's reading, which can prevent certain types of malicious code from running.
2. Information Leaks
            * Directory Indexing: The server allows anyone to see a full list of files inside folders like /img/ and /icons/, similar to looking into a folder on your own computer.
            * Default Files: It found standard files (like README and the /dashboard/ page) that come with XAMPP. These tell an attacker exactly what software you are using.
3. Outdated Software
            * Old PHP Version: Your PHP version (8.0.30) is out of date. Older versions often have known "holes" that hackers can use to get in.
4. Risky Communication Methods
            * TRACE Method: This specific way of communicating with the server is turned on, which could be used by an attacker to steal cookies or sensitive data.

Question:
               * How many antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious?
               * Why is the EICAR file considered safe, yet detected as a threat?
  
  
  

Question
How many antivirus engines flagged the file as malicious?
According to your VirusTotal dashboard, 61 out of 66 security vendors flagged the eicar_com.zip file as malicious.


Why is the EICAR file considered safe, yet detected as a threat?
The EICAR (European Institute for Computer Antimalware Research) file is a unique tool in the cybersecurity world. It is considered safe and detected as a threat for the following reasons:
               * It is not actual malware: The file contains no malicious code, payloads, or instructions that can harm your computer, steal data, or replicate itself. It is essentially just a specific string of text.
               * A Universal "Blank Cartridge": Antivirus companies worldwide have mutually agreed to include this specific text string in their detection databases. It acts like a "blank cartridge" in military training; it allows users to see how their systems react to a threat without the danger of a real infection.
               * Verification Tool: Its primary purpose is to allow IT professionals and users to verify that their antivirus software is correctly installed, active, and capable of triggering alerts and quarantine actions when it encounters a "malicious" signature.
