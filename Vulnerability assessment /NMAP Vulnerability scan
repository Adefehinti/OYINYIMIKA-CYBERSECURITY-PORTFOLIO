## 1. Objective
The goal of this lab was to perform a controlled vulnerability assessment on a local web server (XAMPP) to identify open ports, detect the operating system, and fingerprint service versions. This simulates the **Reconnaissance** phase of a penetration test to identify potential entry points for an attacker.

## 2. Tools & Environment
* **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
* **Target Machine:** Windows 10 Host running **XAMPP** (Apache/MySQL)
* **Networking:** Host-Only Adapter (to ensure a private, isolated testing environment)
* **Primary Tool:** **Nmap (Network Mapper)**

## 3. Methodology
I followed a standard four-step scanning process to ensure a comprehensive audit:

1. **Host Discovery:** Verified the target IP was active using an ICMP echo request (ping).
2. **Port Scanning:** Scanned for the top 1,000 most common ports to identify active services.
3. **Service Version Detection (`-sV`):** Probed open ports to determine the exact version of Apache and MariaDB running.
4. **OS Fingerprinting (`-O`):** Analyzed TCP/IP stack responses to identify the target as a Windows-based system.

**Command Executed:**
```bash
sudo nmap -sV -O 192.168.56.1 (which is my host Ip)


```

### Target Port Summary

| Port | State | Service | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **80/tcp** | Open | http | Apache httpd 2.4.58 ((Win64) OpenSSL/3.1.3 PHP/8.2.12) |
| **135/tcp** | Open | msrpc | Microsoft Windows RPC |
| **139/tcp** | Open | netbios-ssn | Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn |
| **443/tcp** | Open | ssl/http | Apache httpd 2.4.58 ((Win64) OpenSSL/3.1.3 PHP/8.2.12) |
| **445/tcp** | Open | microsoft-ds? | (Windows SMB) |
| **2179/tcp** | Open | vmrdp? | (Windows Remote Desktop) |
| **3306/tcp** | Open | mysql | MySQL (unauthorized) |

## 5. Key Observations

* **Web Server Details**: The target is running **Apache version 2.4.58**. Detailed version strings are visible, which provides a roadmap for version-specific exploit research using databases like Exploit-DB or NVD.
* **Database Exposure**: The **MySQL (3306)** port is open and marked as "unauthorized." This confirms the service is reachable over the network and represents a high-risk entry point for SQL injection or brute-force attacks.
* **OS Confirmation**: Nmap's service info confirms the target OS is **Windows**. This aligns with the expected XAMPP environment and allows an auditor to narrow down OS-specific vulnerabilities.
* **Additional Vectors**: Ports **135 (RPC)**, **139 (NetBIOS)**, and **445 (SMB)** indicate active Windows network services. These are common targets for **lateral movement**, credential harvesting, or "Man-in-the-Middle" (MitM) attacks within a corporate environment.

## 6. Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how efficiently a "passive" observer can gather critical intelligence about a network using industry-standard tools. By utilizing **Nmap**, I successfully transformed raw network data into an actionable risk report, identifying specific vulnerabilities that could lead to a system compromise.

> **Key Takeaway:** Understanding how to identify open ports and fingerprint services is a foundational skill essential for maintaining the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) of organizational data.

By documenting these findings, I have showcased the ability to not only identify technical weaknesses but also to provide the necessary context for remediation—a critical bridge between technical auditing and business security operations.
