#  DVWA SQL Injection Lab: Information Schema Bypass

##  Overview

This lab demonstrates a classic SQL Injection (SQLi) attack on a web application’s "User Search" feature. By inputting logic gates instead of a standard ID, I forced the database to reveal all registered users, bypassing the intended single-result restriction.



##  Objectives

* **Trigger** a database logic error to verify vulnerability.
* **Inject** a "Tautology" (always true) statement to dump the entire user table.
* **Analyze** the server response to confirm successful data exfiltration.



##  Tools Used

* **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App):** A PHP/MySQL web application designed with intentional security flaws.
* **Kali Linux:** The operating system used to host the environment and browser.
* **Firefox Browser:** Used to interact with the target and manipulate URL parameters.




##  Steps Taken

### 1. Identifying the Entry Point

I navigated to the **SQL Injection** module on the DVWA sidebar. I identified a "User ID" input box that takes a number and returns a "First name" and "Surname."

### 2. Testing for Weakness

I tested how the backend handles unexpected characters by entering `Bunmi`. Since this isn't a numeric ID, it indicated the input is likely being placed directly into a query string.

### 3. Executing the Payload

I entered the following payload into the User ID box:
`' OR '1'='1`

**How it works behind the scenes:**
The original server code looks like this:
`SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '$id';`

After my injection, the query becomes:
`SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '' OR '1'='1';`

### 4. Results (As seen in Screenshot 2)

Because `'1'='1'` is always true, the database ignored the `user_id` requirement and returned **every user record** in the table, including:

* admin
* Gordon Brown
* Hack Me
* Pablo Picasso
* Bob Smith

##  Security Implications

* **Privacy Breach:** An attacker can scrape your entire user database, including names, emails, and potentially hashed passwords.
* **Targeted Attacks:** Knowing the full list of usernames allows an attacker to start a "Brute Force" or "Password Spraying" attack on specific accounts.

##  Key Takeaways

* **Input Validation is Not Enough:** Even if you check for text vs. numbers, attackers use characters like `'` and `=` to break the logic.
* **Parameterized Queries:** The only real fix is using **Prepared Statements**. This ensures the database treats `' OR '1'='1` as a literal string of text rather than a command.
* **Error Masking:** The application should never show raw database results or errors to the end-user.
